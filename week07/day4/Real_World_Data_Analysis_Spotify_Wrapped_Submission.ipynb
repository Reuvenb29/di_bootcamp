    "In a highly competitive music‚Äëstreaming market, Spotify‚Äôs annual **Wrapped** campaign has evolved into a year‚Äëend cultural moment. Wrapped uses each listener‚Äôs **own usage data** to generate a personalized summary of their year in audio. This transforms raw data into **storytelling and engagement**, driving brand differentiation, retention, and organic reach.\n"

    "- **Activity metrics:** minute counts, day‚Äëpart/time‚Äëof‚Äëday patterns, discovery of new artists  \n",
    "- **Derived groupings:** top genres, listening personality/archetypes (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Adventurer‚Äù)  \n",

    "- **Descriptive analytics:** summarize a year of events into counts, ranks, and distributions (e.g., top 5 songs, total minutes).  \n",
    "- **Segmentation/labeling:** simple rules or light models to classify a user‚Äôs ‚Äúlistening personality.‚Äù  \n",
    "- **Personalized visualization:** dynamic, per‚Äëuser narrative built from their aggregated data.  \n",
    "- **Experimentation & UX polish:** iteration on story formats that are highly shareable on social platforms.\n"

    "- Marketing would rely more on generic campaigns with lower organic reach.  \n",
