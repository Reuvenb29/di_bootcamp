suggestions for improvement:
- Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code more thoroughly.  For example, a comment before each query explaining what the query is doing would enhance readability.
- Consider using more descriptive variable names if this were to be expanded.  `items` and `customers` are fine for this small example, but for larger projects, more descriptive names would improve readability.
