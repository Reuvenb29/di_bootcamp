suggestions for improvement:
- The `sowpods.txt` file should be checked for existence before attempting to open it.  Handle the `FileNotFoundError` exception gracefully.
- The `get_anagrams` function could be optimized for better performance with larger word lists. Consider using a more efficient data structure like a Trie or hash table to store and search for anagrams.
- Add more comprehensive error handling for invalid user input in `anagrams.py` (not provided).
- Improve the user interface in `anagrams.py` (not provided) to be more robust and user-friendly. Consider using a library to create a more visually appealing menu.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file is missing, preventing a complete assessment of correctness.  The provided `anagrams.py` file seems to correctly implement the UI and input validation as specified.
- Improve error handling.  Instead of just printing 'Invalid input...', provide more specific feedback (e.g., 'Input contains numbers', 'Input contains more than one word').
- The performance could be improved by optimizing the anagram search algorithm in `anagram_checker.py` (which is missing).  Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms for finding anagrams.
- Add comprehensive docstrings to the functions in both files to improve readability and understanding.
