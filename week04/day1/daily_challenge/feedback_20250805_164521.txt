suggestions for improvement:
- The `_build_deck` method is called within `shuffle`.  It's more efficient to only call it once in the constructor. The shuffle method should shuffle the existing deck, not rebuild it every time. This wastes resources. 
- Consider adding error handling or a check for empty deck in the `deal` method.  The current implementation returns a string; a more robust approach might raise an exception or return None.
- Add docstrings to the methods to improve readability and explain their purpose.
